Jupyter script and source files for analysing and visualizing required weather parameters from a satellite (**Sentinel-1**), weather agency station (**Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) - BU College of Agriculture and Forestry Automated Weather Station**), and an action-research program (**Project SARAi**) for generating soil aggregate volumes and excess water contribution used for a 5-year return flood hazard map.
