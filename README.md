Jupyter script and source files for analysing and visualising the required weather parameters from a satellite (**Sentinel-1**), a weather agency station (**Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) - BU College of Agriculture and Forestry Automated Weather Station**), and an action-research program called (**Project SARAi**) for generating soil aggregate volumes and excess water contribution used for flood hazard mapping.
